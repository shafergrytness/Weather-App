# Weather App
An app using [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) and Unity for CS 481 Week 9, done in the MVVM software design pattern. Developed using Xamarin.Forms, the app is deployable on both Android and iOS.

Allows the user to check the current weather in a variety of ways. 

Uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data acquisition and [the Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) for the WebView map (which needs rehosting online).

## Does not include API key! You must edit the appropriate lines in ApiKeys.WeatherKey and map.html with your own key, which you can get here:
https://openweathermap.org/api 
All functionality can be achieved with the free tier of the API.
